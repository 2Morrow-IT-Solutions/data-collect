# Data Collect

### Version 1.0

## Description

Data Collect helps you to explore the data that apps and companies could collect from your device
without
requiring explicit permissions. For obvious reasons, the app is not requiring the Internet
permission. This data is locally shown to you, and it is not collected by any third-party service.

• Dive deep into the details of the data collected by apps, organized into intuitive categories,
helping you to make informed decisions.
• Access and explore your device's data that does not require granting any additional permissions.
